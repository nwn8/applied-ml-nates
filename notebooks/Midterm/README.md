> Author: Nathan Sloss
> Date: 11/11/2025
> Description: This project will test different classification models and features to produce the highest performing machine learning model using the Titanic dataset.

fare	Passenger fare	<br>
cabin	Cabin number	<br>
embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton





## README.md (Required)

Include a professional README.md that introduces your project. Include:
- a clickable link to your notebook file.
- a clickable link to your your peer review Markdown file.
- Instructions on how to set up your virtual environment and run your notebook locally.
-  Write a README.md summarizing your project, dataset, and findings (see below).
1. Review a classmate’s project and provide feedback in peer_review.md (see below).


---

## Peer Review (Required)

Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:

1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
1. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
1. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
1. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

Submission: Submit a short peer review document in your own repository titled peer_review.md.
The peer review must contain a **clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed** along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review.
Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback.
Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well.
Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.
