Link to notebook: https://github.com/albertokabore/ml-04-Midterm-Project-Classification-Analysis/blob/main/Albertkabore_ml.ipynb <br>

Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:

1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?) <br>
   This repo is great!  He did a really wonderful job. Everything is well presented and esy to follow.
2. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
   Yes. He chose to use data that would determine if a text message was spam or ham.  His approach was sensible and easy to follow.  He created new features based on the data that gave a new perspective on the original data.   It was a clever way to train a model.  He concluded that certain features would more likely determine if a text was spam.
3. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
   Yes. he compared Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
4. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
   He did a great job explaining the work along the way. I really enjoyed this notebook.  I don't know what improvements could be made.
