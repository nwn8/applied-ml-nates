## Peer Review (Required)

Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:

1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
1. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
1. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
1. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

Submission: Submit a short peer review document in your own repository titled peer_review.md.
The peer review must contain a **clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed** along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review.
Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback.
Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well.
Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.
